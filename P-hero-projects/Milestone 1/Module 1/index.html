    From the time I was a little girl I have always enjoyed traveling. I love how these experiences give me sense of adventure and freedom. Iâ€™m grateful for these experiences because they have shaped me into the person I am today.  Often times when people think of an event that changed their outlook on life they always focus on the negative experiences. But for me, the moment that really changed my outlook on life was when my family and I took a vacation to Costa Rica.
</p>
<p>
    This event has great significance to me because it made me a more grateful, patient, and outgoing person. This experience all started about three years ago when my mom booked airline tickets to Costa Rica. I remember at the time thinking it would be a completely different experience compared to the vacations I had been on previously. This was my first trip outside of the United States and I was excited about the adventures that were to come. My grandmother was the one that planed this trip which meant that all twelve of my family members would be spending a week inside one house.
